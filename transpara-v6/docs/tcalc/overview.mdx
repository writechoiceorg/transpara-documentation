tCalc is a calculation engine designed for flexible, user-defined calculations within a graph database. It integrates with tModel, the data structure stored in tGraph, allowing users to build and manage calculations across various nodes, metrics, and KPIs. tCalc supports dynamic data inputs from databases, external interfaces, and other sources, ensuring that calculations reflect the most current data.

With tCalc, you can create custom calculations that apply to different levels of the tModel hierarchy. Whether you're calculating metrics for a specific node or aggregating data across multiple objects, tCalc provides a platform that accommodates a wide range of use cases. Key features include several trigger types, dynamic data handling, and customizable calculation templates, making tCalc adaptable to various project requirements.
